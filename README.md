# Naive-Bayes-Implementation
Naive Bayes Classifier used to Predict Income of the 1994 Census

In this report, I will be trying to predict whether a person makes above or below $50,000, based on the 1994 census in the United States. The donors of the data set was from Ronny Kohavi and Barry Becker who do data mining and visualizations for Silicon Graphics. Extraction was done by Barry Becker from the 1994 Census database, it is also known as the [Adult Data Set](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Adult). A set of reasonably clean records was extracted using the following conditions: ((AAGE>16) && (AGI>100) && (AFNLWGT>1)&& (HRSWK>0)).
